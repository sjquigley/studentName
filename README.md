# VisionSite

Welcome to VisionSite! Using a code editor, work through the code prompts in the index.html file to determine your *path moving forward*, complete with inspirational quotes, music, personal goals, and statements of thankfulness. Along the way, you'll learn a little about coding and computer science. After this introduction, you'll be ready to tackle other Codela projects. [Go to Codela](https://codela-k12.github.io/codela-tools/) to find more code-based tools and projects for the English Language Arts classroom.<p>&nbsp;</p>

VisionSite was designed by Pitt students Carter Keith, Domonique Swift, Janet Majekodunmi, and Makye Daniels.   
    
## Get started! 

1. Scroll to the top of this repository and click the green "**Code**" button. Select "**Download ZIP**" to download ALL repository files to your local computer. These are all the project files you'll need to get started building your own website. 

2. Find this project folder in your downloads and move it to a secure place on your local computer. You'll return to this project folder to manage your scripts, images, and other assets. 

3. Download and/or open a text editor like [Pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (Mac / Windows / Linux) or [Code Pad Text Editor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/code-pad-text-editor/adaepfiocmagdimjecpifghcgfjlfmkh?hl=en-GB) for Chromebooks. See instructions below on how to optimize your text editor.       

4. Use the text editor to open your project folder and all project files.   

5. Select the index.html file. Start working with code by reading through the code comments embedded in this HTML document. This is where you'll find all the information you need to work with code! 

6. Once you have modified and added your files to your project file, you'll want to publish your project to the web. GitHub provides a good solution for "free" publishing. [Open GitHub](https://github.com), sign-in, or create a GitHub account.

7. Once you have an account, create a "**new repository**" to store your files. Click  "**uploading an existing file**" and add ALL of your individual project assets to your repository. After each asset is uploaded, hit "**Commit changes**." 

7. Now you'll need to activate GitHub pages to create a website. In the repository top menu, select "**settings**." A new page will open. In the left-hand menu, select "**Pages**." Change the source setting from "**none**" to "**main**" "**/root**" and then Click "**Save**."

8. Refresh your page after one minute. GitHub will provide you with a published GitHub URL. (This process may take more than on minute.)

9. Test the URL in a browser. Magic, no? Actually, it's computer science. <p>&nbsp;</p>
